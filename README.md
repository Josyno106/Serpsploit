# Seo Serp Tool With Diverse Functionalities


## Description

A Search Engine Results Page Tool (SERP) is software used to analyze how various keywords rank on google against other competitors. This app lists at least the top 100 search results from Google for a given keyword. The complete fullstack project will have more than just the Serp feature since the users can save and track data for their desired keywords. This tool targets SEO teams in small to medium companies without a very big budget to spend on expensive serp tools without the additional features offered here. 

## Technologies used
- Javascript
- React / Nextjs 
- Data for Seo Api
- Firebase (to be added later for user management)

## Motivation 
It's almost impossible to find a tool that's fine-tuned to fit a given company perfectly. There'll always be some missing features. This was and has been the case with a company I work with. I decided to take an initiative and create a tailor-made yet flexible solution that can be used not only in our company but by also other companies. 

## How to run the Project
- Clone this github repository
- Open the code in your favorite editor (Vs Code for instance)
- Run `npm install' to install all the depencies
- Open a terminal inside the project directory and run `npm run dev'
